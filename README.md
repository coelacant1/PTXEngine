# uMath3D - Mathematics Library for Embedded and Non-Embedded Devices

> **Work in progress** — the structure may change without notice while working on the first major release.

This code is currently being migrated from ProtoTracer to act as a submodule and generalize the functionality for more use cases.
- Project Goals:
    - Have a generic C++ library that can be used as a backbone to speed up development on microcontrollers as well as desktop computers
    - Re-integrate this functionality as a sub-module into ProtoTracer
    - Create a desktop GUI application that can utilize and simulate the same functionality as the embedded pipeline.

**uMath3D** is a C++17 library targeted for embedded microcontrollers that bundles mathematics, control, signals, and physics features:

* vector, quaternion, matrix math, and rotation conversion
* 2D / 3D / spatial geometry primitives
* signal-processing helpers (FFT, Kalman, filters, noise)
* lightweight physics utilities (springs, bounce, fluid-style vector fields)
* time-step & PID control helpers
* rendering with raytracing/rasterizing + post effects + shaders
* scene creation with animations, mesh deformations, volumetric lighting
* asset tools for custom fonts, images, meshes, and volumes
