# uCore3D - C++17 Math & Render Core for Microcontrollers **and** Desktops

[![compilecheck](https://github.com/coelacant1/uCore3D/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/coelacant1/uCore3D/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

`uCore3D` started as the math backbone of **ProtoTracer** - an embedded 3D rendering engine. It is now a stand-alone **header-first** library that runs on:
* 32-bit Cortex-M / ESP32 boards (STM32, Teensy, ESP32-S3)
* Linux / Windows / macOS desktops
* 8-bit AVR boards (Arduino UNO, Nano)

The same codebase powers hardware **and** a full-speed desktop simulator, so you prototype algorithms on the workstation and drop them onto a board unchanged.

> **Work in progress** - the APIs and structure may change without notice while working on the first major release.
>
> This code is currently being migrated from ProtoTracer to act as a submodule and generalize the functionality for more use cases.
> - **Project Goals**:
>     - Have a generic C++ library that can be used as a backbone to speed up development on microcontrollers as well as desktop computers
>     - Re-integrate this functionality as a sub-module into ProtoTracer
>     - Create a desktop GUI application that can utilize and simulate the same functionality as the embedded pipeline.

## Planned / in-progress

* 4×4 matrix + projection utilities for graphics pipelines
* Additional procedural noise
* Doxygen-based website hosted on GitHub Pages
* BVH builder + on-device path tracer (`ray/`)
* More procedural noise
* Binary asset packer + CLI viewer
