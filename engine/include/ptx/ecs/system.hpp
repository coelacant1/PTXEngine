/**
 * @file system.hpp
 * @brief Base system class for ECS that operates on entities with specific components.
 *
 * TODO: Implement ECS system with the following features:
 * - System registration and execution order
 * - Entity queries (iterate entities with specific components)
 * - System enable/disable
 * - System dependencies and execution ordering
 * - Parallel system execution where possible
 * - System update phases (pre-update, update, post-update, render)
 *
 * Common system examples:
 * - PhysicsSystem (updates transforms based on physics)
 * - RenderSystem (renders meshes)
 * - AnimationSystem (updates animation state)
 * - InputSystem (processes input)
 *
 * @date TBD
