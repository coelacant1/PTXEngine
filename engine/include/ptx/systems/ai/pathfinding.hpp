/**
 * @file pathfinding.hpp
 * @brief A* pathfinding and navigation mesh system.
 *
 * TODO: Implement pathfinding with the following features:
 * - A* pathfinding algorithm
 * - Navigation mesh (navmesh) generation
 * - Navigation mesh queries (find nearest point, raycast)
 * - Path smoothing and optimization
 * - Dynamic obstacle avoidance
 * - Path following behavior
 * - Multi-agent pathfinding (avoiding other agents)
 * - Jump points and off-mesh links
 * - Different agent sizes and movement capabilities
 *
 * Consider using existing libraries:
 * - Recast/Detour for navmesh
 * - Custom grid-based or waypoint-based pathfinding
 *
 * @date TBD
