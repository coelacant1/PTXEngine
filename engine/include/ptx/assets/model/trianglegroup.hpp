/**
 * @class TriangleGroup
 * @brief Represents a dynamic (runtime-sized) group of 3D triangles.
 *
 * This runtime variant replaces an earlier compileâ€‘time templated version. All
 * triangles own vertex-pointer wiring into the internally owned vertex array.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *  - `vertices` owns exactly `GetVertexCount()` elements.
 *  - `triangles` owns exactly `GetTriangleCount()` elements.
 *  - Each Triangle3D's `a`, `b`, `c` pointers either point into `vertices` or are nullptr during construction only.
 *  - `indexGroup` is non-owning; lifetime must exceed this group or remain valid externally.
